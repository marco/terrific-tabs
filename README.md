# terrific-tabs

For when you really, really need a tab.

## Why?

Tabs are great, but sometimes tedious. In some web services, like [Gmail][gmail] and in
[GitHub comments][github comments], pressing a tab jumps you to the next input field. This simple website offers an
alternative to that: a copy-and-pasteable tab character, ready for your disposal at
[skunkmb.github.io/terrific-tabs][terrific tabs].
